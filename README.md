Abstractive Text Summarization using Transformer networks implemented with Keras and Tensorflow

### Abstractive Summarization with Transformers:
Abstractive summarization is the technique of generating a summary of a text from its main ideas, not by copying verbatim most salient sentences from text. There have been many different algorithms and methods for performing this task including the use of RNNs
